## About the workshop
This 2-hour lightening workshop makes a whirlwind tour of basics in Python programming. It also introduces several Python data analytics packages such as Pandas and Matplotlib, and their application in preliminary data exploration and visualization. Workshop participants are required to bring with their own laptops for installation and hands-on exercises. Topics include package installation, program execution, as well as data processing, and what this workshop tries to convey as **"problem-driven data visualization and data-driven exploration."**

## Agenda ##
1. Python and its involvement with data science
2. Data processing
 - from raw data to consistent data
3. Data exploration (EDA)
 - Importing and knowing your data
      1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
      2. Getting the attributes of the your data
      3. Case selection
      4. Basic statistics
      5. Pivot table
 - Data exploration: exploring the data by visualization
      1. Univariate (unidimensional) and bivariate (two-way) data visualization
      2. Multivariate (multidimensional) problem-driven data visualization and data-driven exploration
4. Python: a baby step
